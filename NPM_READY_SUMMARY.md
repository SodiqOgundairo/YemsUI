## 🚀 Next Steps (What YOU Need to Do)

### Phase 1: NPM Account Setup (5 minutes)

- [ ] **Create NPM Account**
  - Go to https://www.npmjs.com/signup
  - Create account and verify email
  - Enable 2FA for security

- [ ] **Create NPM Organization (Optional)**
  - Go to https://www.npmjs.com/org/create
  - Name it `yems-ui`
  - This is optional but recommended for scoped packages

### Phase 2: Pre-Publishing Checks (5 minutes)

- [ ] **Verify Build**

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

  ✅ Already tested - working!

- [ ] **Test Locally**

  ```bash
  npm publish --dry-run
  ```

  This shows what would be published without actually publishing

- [ ] **Update Version (if needed)**
  - Current version: **1.0.0** (ready to publish!)
  - Future releases: `npm version patch|minor|major`

### Phase 3: Publishing (2 minutes)

- [ ] **Login to NPM**

  ```bash
  npm login
  ```

  Enter credentials and 2FA code when prompted

- [ ] **Publish Package**

  ```bash
  npm publish --access=public
  ```

  This makes the scoped package publicly available

- [ ] **Verify Publication**
  ```bash
  npm info @yems-ui/core
  # Or view online: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yems-ui/core
  ```

### Phase 4: Post-Publishing (5 minutes)

- [ ] **Create GitHub Release**
  - Go to GitHub → Releases
  - Create release tag `v1.0.0`
  - Add changelog notes

- [ ] **Share & Announce**
  - Update project README with npm badge
  - Announce on social media
  - Add to portfolio

## 📦 Installation Commands (After Publishing)

Once published, users can install with:

```bash
# For @yems-ui/core (current name)
npm install @yems-ui/core

# They'll also need peer dependencies
npm install react react-dom tailwindcss
```

### Alternative: If You Want "npm install yems-ui"

If you want users to be able to just do `npm install yems-ui`:

1. Change `package.json` name from `"@yems-ui/core"` to `"yems-ui"`
2. Remove the scope (@ symbol)
3. Publish as new package

> Note: You'd need to publish to NPM as a new unscoped package name

2. **Scoped Package**
   - `@yems-ui/core` is a scoped package
   - Installation: `npm install @yems-ui/core`
   - Requires `publishConfig.access = "public"` (already set!)

3. **Peer Dependencies**
   - React 18+ required
   - react-dom required
   - Tailwind CSS v4 required
   - Users install these separately

4. **Tree-shakeable**
   - Only imports needed are bundled
   - Full ESM + CJS support
